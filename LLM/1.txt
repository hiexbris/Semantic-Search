The main objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission, India's second lunar exploration mission, include:

1. Soft landing of a rover on the lunar south pole region, specifically in the high-latitude terrain close to the crater called 'Shackleton.'
2. Conducting scientific experiments and studies aimed at understanding the geological composition of the Moon's polar regions.
3. Proving India's technology capabilities in soft landing on the lunar surface and extending its presence beyond low Earth orbit.
4. Supporting future manned missions by creating an infrastructure in the cis-lunar space environment.
