The Rana Plaza disaster occurred on April 24, 2013, in Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Rana Plaza was a commercial complex that housed several garment factories producing clothing for international brands. On that fateful day, workers reported cracks in the building and pleaded not to be forced to work. However, they were compelled by supervisors to enter the building. Within minutes after the start of their shifts, the eight-story structure suddenly collapsed, causing a massive pile of debris that trapped thousands of people inside. It's believed that the building's structural integrity had been compromised due to substandard construction materials and unauthorized modifications, as well as the addition of extra weight from the garment factories. The collapse resulted in the death of more than 1,100 people and left over 2,500 injured. This tragic event brought global attention to the safety issues and labor conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories and led to improvements in regulations and worker protections.
