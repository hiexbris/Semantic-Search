Human Hemoglobin is a complex protein found in red blood cells, which plays a crucial role in transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. It consists of four polypeptide chains (two alpha chains and two beta chains) held together by non-covalent interactions. Each of these globin chains is attached to a heme group, which contains an iron-containing molecule called a heme. The heme group carries the oxygen molecules. Each hemoglobin molecule can bind four oxygen molecules (O2). This allows for the efficient transportation of oxygen throughout the body. The structure and function of hemoglobin are critical to maintaining life, as it ensures that cells receive enough oxygen to carry out their metabolic processes effectively.
