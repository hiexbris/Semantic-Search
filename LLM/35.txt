1. Eligibility: Residents of India who are earning an income more than the basic exemption limit (Rs. 2.5 lakhs for individuals below 60 years and Rs. 3 lakhs for senior citizens and above 60 years) must file their tax returns. Non-residents with income earned in India are also required to file taxes.
  2. Due Date: The financial year runs from April 1st to March 31st of the subsequent year, and income tax returns should be filed by July 31st of the next year (i.e., for the assessment year 2022-23, the income earned in the financial year 2021-22 should be filed by July 31, 2022).
  3. Tax Deducted at Source (TDS): If you are earning an income that attracts TDS (e.g., salary, interest, rent), the payer will deduct tax at source and deposit it with the government on your behalf. However, it is your responsibility to file your tax return and claim any additional deductions or exemptions that may be applicable.
  4. Tax Payer Identification Number (PAN): Every taxpayer must have a unique Permanent Account Number (PAN). It is mandatory to quote this number on all financial transactions and in the income tax return filing.
  5. ITR forms: The income tax returns are filed in various ITR forms based on the type of income earned. For instance, ITR-1 is for individuals having income from salary or pension, one house property, and agricultural income within the limit of Rs. 5,000 per annum.
  6. Verification of Return: The tax return can be verified electronically through e-Verification using net banking facilities or Aadhaar OTP, or it can also be physically verified by submitting a signed copy of the ITR-V at the designated post office.
  7. Penalties for Non-compliance: Failure to file income tax returns on time may attract penalties such as late filing fee (Rs. 5,000) and interest on unpaid taxes. Additionally, non-filing of returns for more than three consecutive years can lead to the cancellation of the PAN card.
  8. Carry Forward Losses: If you have suffered a loss in any financial year, it can be carried forward and set off against income in subsequent years to reduce the tax liability. However, there are certain conditions and restrictions for doing so.
  9. Revision of Returns: In case of errors or oversights in the filed return, it can be revised within a specific time frame. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) provides guidelines for making revisions to the income tax returns online.
 10. Assessment: Based on the information provided in the income tax return and other records maintained by the Income Tax Department, your return may be selected for further scrutiny or assessment. During this process, you will be required to provide additional documents or clarify certain aspects of your return. If necessary, an assessment order will be passed, which may result in revised tax liability or refunds.
