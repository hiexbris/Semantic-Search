4. Thermidorian Reaction (1794-1799) marked the fall of Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror, with a more moderate government taking power.
5. Directory (1795-1799) was established as a five-member executive body that attempted to stabilize France politically and economically but faced internal conflicts and external threats.
6. Consulate (1799-1804) saw Napoleon Bonaparte seizing power and implementing a series of political, administrative, and military reforms.
