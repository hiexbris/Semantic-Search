Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when a massive object, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, causes the light from a more distant object to bend around it. This effect is due to gravity and can make multiple images of the distant object appear, creating an "arc" shape. The amount of bending depends on the mass of the object causing the gravitational lensing and the distance between the objects. This cosmic magnifying glass helps astronomers observe distant galaxies that would otherwise be too faint to see.
