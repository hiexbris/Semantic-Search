1. Address Space: IPv4 uses a 32-bit address space, which provides 4.3 billion unique addresses. In contrast, IPv6 uses a 128-bit address space, enabling approximately 3.4 x 10^38 unique addresses, a significant increase over IPv4.

2. Address Representation: IPv4 addresses are usually represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 addresses are written as hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334).

3. Address Classes: In IPv4, the address space is divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E), each with a different default subnet mask, allowing for a certain number of networks and hosts. With IPv6, there are no predefined address classes, making the network configuration more straightforward and flexible.

4. Header Structure: The header structure of IPv4 and IPv6 is different in terms of fields and their positions. Some fields, like Time to Live (TTL), have remained consistent between both versions, but others, such as the checksum field, are not present in IPv6 headers.

5. Header Length: The minimum header length for IPv4 is 20 bytes, while it is only 40 bytes for IPv6. This difference results from additional fields added to the IPv6 header, making it more flexible and capable of handling a vast number of addresses.

6. Multicast Support: Both versions support multicasting; however, IPv6 has a more robust multicast architecture, with improved address allocation, better routing, and stronger security features compared to IPv4.

7. Mobile Networks: IPv6 is designed to handle the growing number of mobile devices by providing built-in support for mobility and autoconfiguration capabilities that simplify network management in wireless environments.

8. Security: IPv6 incorporates stronger security mechanisms from the outset, with features like source address verification and mandatory use of encryption for neighbor discovery and router advertisements, which are optional in IPv4.
