Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on statistical pattern discovery in data and can be categorized into three types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

   Deep Learning (DL), on the other hand, is a subset of Machine Learning that is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. In simple terms, it's a type of machine learning where neural networks consist of multiple layers, allowing for learning of complex patterns in data. Deep learning models are particularly effective in dealing with large datasets and are widely used in areas such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.
