Here's a simple recipe for Bengali Rosogolla:

Ingredients:
- 1 liter full fat milk (preferably buffalo milk)
- 1/2 cup lemon juice or white vinegar
- 4 tablespoons of plain all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons of semolina (suji)
- Sugar syrup:
   - 3 cups water
   - 2 cups sugar
   - 5 green cardamoms, crushed
   - few strands of saffron soaked in 1 tbsp warm milk

Instructions:
1. Boil the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat until it reduces to about 3/4 cup. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
2. Once reduced, add the lemon juice or vinegar and stir gently. The milk will curdle immediately.
3. Drain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth-lined colander. Gather the edges of the cloth and tie it into a knot, hanging the bag over the pan to drain excess water. Let it hang for about 15 minutes or until all the water drains out.
4. In a bowl, combine the flour, semolina, and a little bit of water to make a smooth paste.
5. Squeeze the soft cheese mass into small lemon-sized balls. Dip each ball into the flour-semolina paste, ensuring it's well coated.
6. Place the floured balls gently into a wide, heavy-bottomed pan filled with enough water to cover them. Cover the pan and cook on low heat for about 20 minutes or until they expand in size and become soft.
7. Prepare the sugar syrup by boiling water, sugar, cardamom, and saffron in a separate large pan over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves completely.
8. Once the balls are cooked, carefully remove them from the water using a slotted spoon, and immerse them into the hot sugar syrup. Let them cool completely in the syrup.
9. Serve Bengali Rosogolla chilled, with more sugar syrup poured over them if desired. Enjoy!
