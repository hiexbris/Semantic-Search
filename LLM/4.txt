Demonetization in India, announced on November 8th, 2016, aimed to eliminate high-denomination banknotes (INR 500 and INR 1,000) from circulation to combat corruption, black money, and the financing of terrorism. The immediate impact was significant disruption in the economy as people had to exchange or deposit their old currency notes at banks, which faced severe queues and logistical challenges.

During this period, economic activities were stalled due to a lack of liquidity in cash, affecting various sectors like retail trade, agriculture, construction, transportation, and services. Many businesses shut down temporarily, and laborers faced unemployment due to the halt in cash transactions. The informal sector was particularly hard-hit as it heavily relies on cash transactions.

However, in the long term, demonetization had some positive effects. It led to a formalization of the economy, increased tax compliance, reduced corruption, and curbed terror financing activities. But critics argue that these benefits were offset by the short-term economic slowdown and hardships faced by the common people, as well as the lack of adequate alternative arrangements for smooth cashless transactions. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reported that 99% of the demonetized notes had been returned to banks within a year after the announcement, indicating that most citizens complied with the directive.

In summary, the economic impact of demonetization in India was an initial short-term disruption followed by a potential long-term boost for transparency and accountability, although it remains controversial due to the challenges faced by citizens and businesses during the transition period.
