The countries that participate in the G7 Summit typically include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These are the current members as of 2023. However, for any accurate information regarding the G7 Summit 2024, I would recommend consulting official sources or reliable news outlets closer to that year.
