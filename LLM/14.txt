The principle of comparative advantage is an economic concept that states that a country or individual should specialize in producing and exporting goods for which it has a relatively lower opportunity cost compared to other countries or individuals. This principle was first introduced by David Ricardo in 1817. By focusing on their areas of relative efficiency, countries can increase overall global production, leading to mutual benefits and international trade. The principle helps explain why countries engage in trade despite differences in productivity levels and resource endowments.
