The White Tiger is a novel by Aravind Adiga set in India. The story follows Balram Halwai, a poor village boy who becomes a driver for an wealthy family in New Delhi and eventually starts his own successful entrepreneurial venture, which he names "The White Tiger" after the car he drives.

Throughout the novel, Balram narrates his life story, describing the harsh realities of India's caste system and the corruption that permeates every level of society. He details how he schemes and manipulates those around him in order to achieve success, eventually fleeing the country with the money he has earned. The novel ends with Balram writing a letter to the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, seeking China's investment in India as a means of escaping the cycle of poverty and corruption that he believes is holding his homeland back.

The White Tiger is a critique of modern India and its caste system, as well as a story of one man's struggle to rise above his circumstances. It won the Man Booker Prize in 2008.
