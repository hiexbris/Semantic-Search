Freshwater scarcity in Cape Town, South Africa, has been primarily addressed through the implementation of stringent water restrictions due to a severe drought that started in 2015. The city's primary source of water, the Theewaterskloof Dam, reached dangerously low levels, putting the "Day Zero" scenario (the complete shutdown of municipal taps) into effect. As of now, the dam level has recovered somewhat, but the city remains in a state of water crisis and is closely monitoring its usage to avoid another Day Zero.
