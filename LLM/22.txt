A vaccine triggers an immune response in the body without causing the actual disease. This is done by introducing a small, harmless piece of the pathogen (like a weakened or dead virus or bacteria) that the immune system recognizes as foreign. The immune system responds by producing antibodies specific to that pathogen. If the person is later exposed to the actual disease, their immune system will recognize it and be able to quickly fight it off because of these pre-made antibodies. This is called active immunity.
