Half-life in radioactive decay refers to the time it takes for half of the atoms in a radioactive substance to decay or change into another element. It is a characteristic property of a particular nuclide and does not depend on external factors such as temperature, pressure, or the physical state of the material. The term "half-life" is logarithmic, meaning that if a radioactive sample is left alone for one half-life, it will have lost half of its initial radioactivity. If left for another half-life, it will lose half of the remaining activity, and so on. This decay rate follows an exponential curve, which is described by the equation N = N0 * e^(-kt), where N is the number of remaining atoms at time t, N0 is the initial number of atoms, k is a constant related to the half-life (k = ln(2)/T1/2), and e is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828). This equation allows us to calculate how much radioactivity remains in a sample over time.
