The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake based on the amplitude of seismic waves, specifically the size of the wave at a particular frequency that is most easily detected by seismographs. It's a logarithmic scale, meaning each whole number increase in magnitude corresponds to a tenfold increase in the seismic energy released. For example, an earthquake measuring 7 on the Richter scale is ten times more powerful than one measuring 6.
