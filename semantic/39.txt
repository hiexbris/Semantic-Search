Backpropagation is an algorithm used for training artificial neural networks. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. **Forward Propagation**: The network makes a prediction using the input data. Each neuron in the network applies an activation function (like sigmoid or ReLU) to its weighted sum of inputs. This process continues until the output layer is reached, resulting in a predicted output.

2. **Error Backpropagation**: The error (difference between the predicted and actual output) is calculated for each neuron in the output layer. This error is then propagated backwards through the network using the chain rule to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network.

The key advantage of backpropagation is that it allows us to efficiently compute gradients for all weights and biases in a single pass through the data, rather than having to perform multiple forward passes as we would with naive methods. This makes training deep neural networks practical.

In terms of mathematics, the backpropagation algorithm can be seen as computing the gradient of the cost function (the loss) using the chain rule from multivariable calculus. The gradient is then used in a learning algorithm like stochastic gradient descent to update the weights and biases of the network, effectively allowing it to "learn" from its mistakes.

In practice, backpropagation is often combined with a mini-batch learning approach, where instead of computing the gradients for a single example, we compute them for a small batch (usually 32-512 examples) of training data. This helps to reduce variance and improve the efficiency of learning.

The backpropagation algorithm is fundamental to the operation of neural networks and lies at the heart of modern machine learning research. It's named after the "backpropagation through time" algorithm, which was first published in 1986 by Ronald J. Williams and Paul Hinton. The logic of backpropagation comes from the chain rule in calculus, which allows us to compute the derivative of a composite function by differentiating each component function in turn.
