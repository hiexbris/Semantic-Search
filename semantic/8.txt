1. What is CRISPR? (Answer: CRISPR is a tool used for editing DNA with high precision, discovered as an immune system in microbes to help protect them from invading viruses.)

2. How does CRISCR-Cpf1 differ from CRISPR-Cas9? (Answer: CRISPR-Cpf1 differs in several ways, including the requirement of only a single RNA and its smaller size which makes it easier to deliver into cells and tissues.)

3. What is the goal for the miniature CRISPR, CasMINI? (Answer: The goal for CasMINI is to make the molecule as small as possible to easily traverse inside of cells and get to its DNA target.)

4. Why is using CRISPR super easy, flexible, and robust compared to other technologies? (Answer: Using CRISPR is easy, flexible, and robust because it only takes a couple of weeks and a bit more than a few hundred dollars to set up, in contrast to other technologies that take multiple years and millions of dollars to set up.)

5. What are some concerns about using CRISPR? (Answer: Some concerns about using CRISPR include potential irreversible effects on the environment, and the high costs associated with current CRISPR medicine.)

6. How can we make the technology of CRISPR reversible in the future? (Answer: Hopefully, in the future we can make this technology reversible by installing a switch so that if we make something that turns out to be less than ideal, we still have some way to reset it.)

7. What strategies does the human body have to prevent foreign DNA from getting inside? (Answer: The human body has many strategies to prevent foreign DNA from getting in, including having cells designed to resist any invading DNA.)
