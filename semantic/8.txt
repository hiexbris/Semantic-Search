1) In a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, CRISPR "spacer" sequences are transcribed into short RNA sequences (CRISPR RNAs or crRNAs) that guide the system to matching DNA sequences. When the target DNA is found, Cas9, one of the enzymes produced by the CRISPR system, binds to the DNA and cuts it, shutting off the targeted gene. Researchers can modify Cas9 to activate gene expression instead of cutting the DNA.

2) CRISPR-Cas9 is an efficient and customizable alternative to other genome editing tools. Unlike other tools, it doesn't need separate cleaving enzymes because the CRISPR system itself can cut DNA strands. It can also be easily matched with tailor-made "guide" RNA (gRNA) sequences designed to lead them to their DNA targets.

3) In the field of genome engineering, "CRISPR" or "CRISPR-Cas9" is used to refer to various systems that can be programmed to target specific stretches of genetic code and edit DNA at precise locations. With these systems, researchers can modify genes in living cells and organisms, potentially correcting mutations at precise locations in the human genome to treat genetic diseases. Other systems like CRISPR-Cas13 are available that target RNA, offering alternate avenues for use with unique characteristics.
