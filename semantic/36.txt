The provided text discusses several properties, applications, and synthesis methods of graphene. Here is a summary:

1. Properties: Graphene is a two-dimensional material made of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. It has exceptional electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, and flexibility. Graphene's electronic properties are influenced by the bonding and anti-bonding (valance and conduction bands) of its pi orbitals. The electrons and holes in graphene have zero effective mass at the Dirac point, making them massless Dirac Fermions.
2. Synthesis: Graphene can be synthesized through three main methods: mechanical exfoliation (such as Scotch Tape method), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and liquid phase exfoliation.
3. Applications: Due to its unique properties, graphene has numerous potential applications, including use in electronics, energy storage, composites for aerospace, coatings, sensors, and more. Graphene films can be used in electric field emission displays due to their high aspect ratio and efficient electron tunneling.
4. Types of Graphene: There are several types of graphene, such as monolayer (true graphene), graphene oxide, graphene nanoplatelets, graphene nanoribbons, and graphene quantum dots, as well as graphene-enabled products like ink or masterbatches.
5. Chemical reactivity: Graphene has a high ratio of edge atoms and is very reactive due to its two-dimensional structure. Defects within the sheet increase its chemical reactivity. The onset temperature for reaction between single-layer graphene and oxygen gas is below 260Â°C (530 K).
6. Self-repair: Graphene has the ability to self-repair holes in its sheets when exposed to carbon-containing molecules like hydrocarbons, with pure carbon atoms aligning into hexagons and filling the holes.
7. Limitations: Despite promising results in various studies, there are still challenges to overcome before graphene can be widely utilized in applications such as biomedicine.
