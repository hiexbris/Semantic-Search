1. Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure, derived from graphite.
2. It has exceptional properties such as high thermal and electrical conductivity, elasticity, toughness, lightness, and strength.
3. Graphene is 200 times more resistant than steel and five times lighter than aluminum.
4. Applications of graphene are found in various sectors including energy, construction, health, and electronics.
5. The term "graphene" was first defined by Hanns-Peter Boehm in 1987, and it was isolated and characterized by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester in 2004.
