1. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is a commonly used medication for pain relief and fever reduction. It is available as a generic drug under various brand names, including Tylenol and Panadol.

2. In adults, the recommended dose of paracetamol is typically 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours, up to a maximum of 4 grams (4,000 mg) per day. However, the appropriate dose may vary based on individual factors and should be determined by a healthcare provider.

3. Paracetamol is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the Western world and accounts for a significant number of drug overdoses in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

4. Long-term use of paracetamol has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney impairment, and kidney cancer. Using paracetamol regularly at a higher dose (more than 2â€“3 grams daily) significantly increases the risk of these adverse effects.

5. Pregnant individuals can use acetaminophen for pain relief and fever reduction under the guidance of their healthcare provider, as current evidence does not conclusively link its use to fetal developmental issues. Breastfeeding mothers may also safely use paracetamol for pain relief and fever reduction.

6. In pediatric populations, the recommended dosage for children aged 2 to 12 is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours or 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. The maximum single dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen is 75 mg/kg.
