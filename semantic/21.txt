The usual dose for adults is either 500mg or 1g. For adults taking 500mg tablets, the guideline is to take two tablets, four times in 24 hours, with a minimum of 4 hours between doses and a maximum of eight tablets in 24 hours. If taking 1g tablets, do not exceed four tablets in 24 hours. It's important to note that adults weighing less than 50kg should check the maximum dose with their doctor or pharmacist. For children, the dosage depends on age and weight, so it is recommended to consult a doctor or pharmacist for the correct dose.
