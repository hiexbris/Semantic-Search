1. To find the hypotenuse (the longest side) of a right triangle given two sides:

   - Let a represent one side, and b represent the other side.
   - Square both values (a² and b²).
   - Add the squared values together (a² + b²).
   - Take the square root of that sum to find the hypotenuse (c = √(a² + b²)).

Examples:
- If a = 3, and b = 4, then c = √(3² + 4²) = √9 + 16 = 5
- If a = 7, and b = 24, then c = √(7² + 24²) = √49 + 576 = 25 (approximately)

2. To find either of the shorter sides given the hypotenuse and one side:

   - Let a represent one side, and b represent the other side.
   - Square the length of the hypotenuse (c²).
   - Subtract the square of the known side from the squared hypotenuse (c² - a² = b²)
   - Take the square root of both sides to find the value for one of the shorter sides.

Examples:
- If a = 3, and c = 5, then b = √(5² - 3²) = √25 - 9 = 4
- If b = 12, and c = 20, then a = √(20² - 12²) = √400 - 144 = 7 (approximately)
