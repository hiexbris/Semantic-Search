The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b): a² + b² = c². This is also expressed as: c² = a² + b². The theorem is named after the Greek philosopher Pythagoras. However, knowledge about this theorem can be traced back to around 1900–1600 BC in Babylonian mathematics.
