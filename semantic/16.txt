1) Power is delivered directly from a DC source to the motor, while power is given to an AC motor by inducing rotation. (Found in the text)

2) A DC motor uses three types of losses: friction loss, iron loss, and copper loss. (Found in the text)

3) An AC motor does not require brushes and commutators as a DC motor does because it doesn't produce direct current. (Implied from the information that DC motors need brushes and commutators to generate DC current)

4) AC generators are stronger and easier to manufacture than DC generators. (Found in the text)

5) The slip of an induction motor is defined as the difference between the synchronous speed and the rotor speed, expressed as a percentage of the synchronous speed. (Found in the text)
