1. To reissue a lost or damaged passport, you can apply online through the VFS Global website (<https://visa.vfsglobal.com/usa/en/ind/apply-passport>). In case of emergency travel due to an emergency like serious illness or death in the family, you should apply for an Emergency Certificate (EC) on the Consulate General of India, San Francisco website (<www.cgisf.gov.in>).

2. The new passport will have a new passport number.

3. If your passport expired more than three years ago, you'll need to undergo fresh police verification.

4. An ordinary Indian passport contains 36 or 60 pages and is valid for 10 years from the date of issue. For international travel, a passport must be valid for at least six months.

5. To include your spouse's name in your passport, you will need to submit one of the following documents along with your application:
   - Marriage Certificate issued by the Indian Mission/Post abroad.
   - Marriage Certificate issued by Foreign Government, duly attested/apostille either by the Indian Mission/Post in the jurisdiction from where the Marriage Certificate was issued or Concerned Authority in USA.
   - Marriage Certificate issued in India by Indian authorities (Marriage Officer/Registrar of Marriage).
   - Marriage Certificate issued by Foreign Embassy/High Commission/Consulate of that country in USA (to which the foreign spouse is a citizen).

6. As for your question about Aadhaar and passports, I found no information in the text to confirm or deny this connection. However, there have been proposals and pilot projects related to linking Aadhaar to SIM cards and government services, but it's unclear if these plans extend to passports.
