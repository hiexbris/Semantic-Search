In India, the President serves a primarily ceremonial role but also holds significant powers in ensuring the smooth functioning of the government. The President appoints key officials, administers Union Territories, summons and dissolves Parliament sessions, grants pardons, and represents India in international forums. However, the President's actions are guided by the advice of the Prime Minister and their Cabinet.

In practice, the President is not entirely a rubber stamp as they can ask ministers to reconsider actions, offer private advice, convey warnings, and make public speeches indicating differences in view with the government. The President's role is more akin to that of the British monarch or monarchs in countries like the Netherlands or Spain, serving as a referee over a parliamentary system where ministers possess the real power.

The Indian presidency differs from most presidencies across the world as the President does not exercise executive powers directly. Instead, they act on the advice of ministers. The Prime Minister is the head of government and has the responsibility for executive power in India, with the President's constitutional duty being to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and the law. The position of Prime Minister is not described extensively in the Indian constitution but holds a crucial role in the government of India by enjoying majority in the Lok Sabha.

The President can ask ministers for reconsideration, offer private advice, convey warnings, and make public speeches indicating differences in view with the government, although their actions are guided by the advice of the Prime Minister and their Cabinet. It is the responsibility of the President to ensure compliance with the constitution in performing their duties. The Executive power of the country is vested in the President and is exercised by the President either directly or through officers subordinate to them, according to the Constitution. Parliament may accord additional executive powers to the President, which can be further delegated by the President to Governors of states. Union Cabinet with the Prime Minister as its head should aid and advise the President in performing their functions. The Council of Ministers or Prime Minister are not accountable legally for advice tendered to the President, but it is the sole responsibility of the President to ensure compliance with the constitution in performing their duties. The President or their subordinate officers are bound by the provisions of the Constitution, notwithstanding any advice by the Union Cabinet. The President can also exercise oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and decisions of the Executive under the Internal Security Act and the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. As a component of the legislature together with Parliament, the President is jointly vested with legislative authority, primarily exercising their function in assenting to bills passed by Parliament. The President may not refuse to assent to bills that Parliament has validly passed, except in certain circumstances.
