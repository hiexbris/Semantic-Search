1. The concept of comparative advantage was first articulated by British political economist David Ricardo in 1817 to argue for the benefits of free trade.
2. In a world with multiple countries and commodities, comparative advantage is valid if we consider averages across all commodities instead of individual pairs of commodities.
3. Deardorff's general law of comparative advantage is a model that takes into account tariffs, transportation costs, and other obstacles to trade.
4. Shiozawa developed a new theory of international value based on Ricardo's cost-of-production theory of value, incorporating many countries, commodities, production techniques, input trade, and durable capital goods with constant efficiency during a predetermined period.
5. Haberler reformulated the theory of comparative advantage by introducing the concept of a production possibility curve into international trade theory, providing an opportunity-cost formulation.
6. The United States enjoys a comparative advantage in the production of cloth because its opportunity cost of cloth is lower than France's. Conversely, France has a comparative advantage in wine due to its lower opportunity cost for wine.
7. Specialization and trade based on comparative advantage expand consumption possibilities by allowing consumers access to bundles of goods they could not have produced themselves in closed economies.
8. The theory of comparative advantage can be extended to situations with many goods, countries, non-constant returns, and multiple factors of production.
9. Economists like Dornbusch, Fisher, Samuelson, Deardorff, Dixit, Norman, and Haberler have responded with weaker generalizations of the principle of comparative advantage, acknowledging that countries will tend to export goods for which they have a comparative advantage rather than strictly adhering to the theory.
10. Empirical work testing the predictions of comparative advantage often involves examining relationships between relative labor productivity and international trade patterns.
