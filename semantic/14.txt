In economics, a comparative advantage occurs when a country can produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another country. This principle was developed by political economist David Ricardo to argue for free trade, suggesting that countries are better off specializing in what they enjoy a comparative advantage in and importing the goods in which they lack a comparative advantage. The theory is based on understanding the idea of opportunity cost, which refers to the foregone benefits from choosing one alternative over others.
