Demonetization in India (2016) led to a temporary reduction in economic activity, estimated to be at least 3 percentage points in November and December 2016. However, the effects began to dissipate in the following months. The impact was an order of magnitude smaller than the decline in cash itself, suggesting that households adapted by using other forms of payment or informal lines of credit. This can be seen through the doubling of transactions using Indian e-wallet technology and a substantial increase in credit- and debit-card transactions. By March 2017, new bills in circulation in the median district represented 77% of the value of the old currency, and by June 2017, the shortage was mostly over.
