1. Absorption of light: Chlorophylls in the thylakoids of chloroplasts absorb light, which is converted into energy. This energy is used to remove electrons from water and form oxygen. The electrons then pass to a major electron acceptor called Quinine.

2. Transfer Of Electrons: Not found. (This step was not explicitly mentioned in the text provided)

3. Production Of ATP: After the light-dependent reactions, chemical energies are produced. These energies are used by animals and humans when they consume plants.

4. Carbon Fixation: The energy produced is used for the fixation of carbon dioxide into glucose or other organic compounds in a series of reactions called the Calvin cycle. This takes place during the light-independent phase of photosynthesis.
