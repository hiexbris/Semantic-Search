1. Hemoglobin is a protein complex found within red blood cells. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and carbon dioxide back to the lungs.
2. When red blood cells are broken down or expire, hemoglobin is released into circulation.
3. This free hemoglobin is then broken down by macrophages into heme and globin.
4. The heme molecule undergoes two reactions: an oxidation reaction that produces biliverdin (a green color pigment) and iron, and a subsequent reduction reaction that creates bilirubin (a yellow color tetrapyrrole pigment).
5. Bilirubin is not soluble in the blood, so it is bound to serum albumin for transport through the bloodstream.
6. When bilirubin reaches the liver, it is conjugated with glucuronic acid by the enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase, creating a water-soluble compound called bilirubin diglucuronide (conjugated bilirubin).
7. Conjugated bilirubin is then excreted into the gallbladder and eventually enters the intestinal tract via bile.
8. In the intestine, symbiotic bacteria convert bilirubin into urobilinogen, which is further metabolized into stercobilin and stool's characteristic brown coloration. Some urobilinogen is reabsorbed back into the gastrointestinal cells.
