1. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs.
2. Each hemoglobin molecule contains four subunits: two alpha (α) and two beta (β).
3. Oxygen binds reversibly to iron atoms in the center of each heme group within the porphyrin ring of the protein.
4. The binding of oxygen causes a change in shape, increasing the efficiency of oxygen transport.
5. In the absence of haptoglobin, hemoglobin can be taken up by CD163 in macrophages for degradation.
6. Haptoglobin polymers are immediately recognized by CD163 and endocytosed.
7. The concentration of Hp is lower in individuals with the Hp2-2 phenotype compared to those with the Hp1-1 and Hp1-2 phenotypes, making them more susceptible to Hb-related oxidative stress.
8. Hemoglobin's ability to bind oxygen cooperatively and be regulated allosterically contributes to its function in transporting oxygen.
9. The development of α and β genes created the potential for hemoglobin to be composed of multiple distinct subunits.
10. The preduplication ancestor of the α and β genes was a dimer made up of identical globin subunits, which then evolved to assemble into a tetrameric architecture after the duplication.
11. Johann Friedrich Engelhart determined the molecular mass of hemoglobin in 1825, making it the first determination of a protein's molecular mass.
