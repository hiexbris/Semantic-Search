The Rana Plaza collapse happened on 24 April 2013 when the eight-story Rana Plaza commercial building collapsed due to a structural failure, killing 1,134 people and leaving thousands more injured. The building housed garment factories, a bank, and apartments, and was constructed in 2006 without proper permits. On 23 April 2013, large structural cracks were discovered in the Rana Plaza building, but warnings to avoid using the building after the cracks appeared were ignored by the garment factory owners on the upper floors, who ordered workers to return the following day.
