The Richter scale measures earthquakes based on the amplitude of seismic waves, which is a relatively simple measurement. However, this scale has become minimal in the 21st century, and other scales like the moment magnitude scale are now more commonly used. This new scale not only considers the amplitude of the shock but also factors in the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The shaking of the earth is measured at a given location using scales such as the Modified Mercalli intensity scale, Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and European Macroseismic Scale. Each unit in these scales represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935.
