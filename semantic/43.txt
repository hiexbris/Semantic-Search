1. Can IPv4 and IPv6 communicate with each other?
   - Yes, they can coexist within the same network, but they are not designed to be interoperable. Communication between them requires dual-stack devices or intermediate translation mechanisms such as tunneling techniques.

2. What is the main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 in terms of address size?
   - The main difference is that IPv4 uses a 32-bit address while IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, providing IPv6 with a much larger pool of unique addresses.

3. What is the primary function of both IPv4 and IPv6?
   - The primary function of both IPv4 and IPv6 is to send and receive data across the internet, routed to the correct device, independent of the underlying networking infrastructure.

4. Is IPv6 directly interoperable with IPv4?
   - No, IPv6 was not designed to be directly interoperable with IPv4. Translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks.

5. What is the significance of the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses?
   - The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses signifies that there are not enough unique IP addresses to accommodate the increasing demand of connected devices, making IPv6 necessary for future growth in internet connectivity.

6. What is Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) used for?
   - Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is a method employed in IPv6 where the device itself can autoconfigure its own address without an external party or protocol, reducing overall network traffic.
