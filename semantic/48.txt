Salim Ali was an Indian ornithologist who made significant contributions to bird study and conservation in India. He is known for his book "The Book of Indian Birds" which became a seminal natural history volume across India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. His name has become synonymous with bird conservation and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).

Ali's interest in birds was sparked at a young age when he shot a yellow-throated sparrow and was introduced to the BNHS collection by W.S. Millard, who identified the bird for him. He went on to study ornithology, and his work included historical research into the contributions of Mughal emperors to natural history.

Ali played a crucial role in ensuring the survival of the BNHS and influenced other members of his family to take up ornithology. His cousin, Humayun Abdulali, became an ornithologist. He also wrote numerous journal articles, books, and even an autobiography called "The Fall of a Sparrow".

Several bird species were named after him, such as Salim Ali's swift (Apus salimalii) and the eastern population of Finn's weaver (Ploceus megarhynchus salimalii). He also published books on various bird species in India, including "Birds of Kutch", "Indian Hill Birds", and "Birds of the Eastern Himalayas".

The Salim Ali Sanctuary in Goa was named after him and is a popular destination for birdwatching. The best time to visit is during the winter months, from October to March. The sanctuary features many migratory birds that are in residence during this period.

In 1985, on his 100th birth anniversary, the Postal Department of India released a set of two postal stamps in his honor. A collection of his shorter letters and writings was published in 2006.
