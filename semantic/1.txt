1. Chandrayaan-3 is a moon mission operated by India's space agency ISRO. It aims to soft land on the lunar surface and deploy a rover for in-situ experiments.

2. The rover has two payloads: Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS), which will attempt to find materials from the ancient lunar crust. Additionally, one payload, the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE), will measure spectral and polarimetric radiation to understand signatures of habitable Earth-like planets.

3. The mission has three main objectives: landing on the moon safely, enabling the rover to rove on the lunar surface, and conducting in-situ scientific experiments on the lunar surface.

4. If successful, Chandrayaan-3 will make India the fourth nation to land a spacecraft on the moon, joining the Soviet Union, the United States, and China.
