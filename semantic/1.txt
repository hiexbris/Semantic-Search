1. The main objectives of Chandrayaan-3 mission are:
    - Demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface.
    - Study spectral and polarimetric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit using the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload.
    - Measure thermal conductivity and temperature with Chandraâ€™s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE).
    - Study seismicity around the landing site with Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA).
    - Estimate plasma density and its variations using Langmuir Probe (LP).
    - Conduct lunar laser ranging studies with a passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA.
    - Analyze the lunar surface using Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown on the lunar surface payloads in Rover module.
