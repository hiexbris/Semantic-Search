* Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the overarching system that uses computer science and data to enable problem-solving in machines.
* Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
* Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex patterns and relationships in data, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
* DL solutions are trained using large amounts of data and algorithms that can learn and improve over time, making them well-suited for complex, real-world problems.
* DL encompasses various architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), and autoencoders.
* Deep learning requires more data volume and computational resources compared to ML.
* While ML models typically require feature engineering with human intervention, deep learning models perform feature engineering with minimal human intervention using feedback from known errors.
