Machine Learning and Deep Learning differ in their complexity level and the types of tasks they are suited for. While both are subsets of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to mimic the learning process of the human brain. In contrast, Machine Learning can automatically adapt with minimal human interference without necessarily using ANNs. Deep Learning is more complex and is particularly well-suited for tasks involving large amounts of data and pattern recognition in images or sounds.
