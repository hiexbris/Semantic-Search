Here is a simplified version of the Bengali Rosogolla recipe as described:

1. Prepare chenna by boiling full cream milk with lemon juice until it curdles, then strain and press to remove excess liquid.
2. Knead the chenna gently but thoroughly to form a soft dough, making sure no cracks appear.
3. Roll the chenna dough into small balls.
4. Boil sugar in water to make sugar syrup. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the chenna balls and cook for about 20 minutes.
5. After boiling, transfer the chenna balls immediately into ice-cold water. This helps the balls maintain their shape and bulginess.
6. Serve the rosogolla in sugar syrup immediately after lunch or dinner.
