The Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) are prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. Their function is to regulate and standardize the presentation of financial statements for entities, ensuring that they meet the needs of users who are not in a position to require an entity to prepare reports tailored to their particular information needs. Specifically, Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, deals with the preparation of profit and loss statements, and the disclosure of accounting policies among other things. It also provides for comparisons between Ind AS 1 and the corresponding International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1. For example, while IAS 1 allows for either a single statement approach or a two-statement approach in presenting the Statement of Profit and Loss, Ind AS 1 follows a specific format where profit or loss is presented in a separate statement that immediately precedes the statement presenting comprehensive income. The amendments to Ind AS 1 are also specified, which apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023.
