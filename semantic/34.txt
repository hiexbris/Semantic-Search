The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional cricket league in India. Each team consists of a maximum of 25 players, with a limit of 8 overseas players. The team that accumulates the most points during the regular season, which runs from September to March and includes 26 matches, is declared the IPL champions and presented with the League Winners' Shield.

In case two or more teams are tied on points, the following criteria are applied in order:
1. Head-to-head records between the tied teams.
2. The team with the higher number of points in matches between all tied teams.
3. If the points remain equal, then goals scored in these matches will be considered.
4. If the tie still persists, the team that has conceded fewer goals during the league stage will be ranked higher.
5. A playoff will take place if there are three teams tied for the top positions.

The top two clubs after the regular season automatically progress to the IPL playoffs, while the third-through-sixth ranked teams participate in a playoff. The team that wins the final playoff match is declared the IPL Cup winners.
