The difference between GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and GNP (Gross National Product) is that GDP defines its scope according to location, while GNI defines its scope according to ownership. In a global context, world GDP and world GNI are equivalent terms. GDP includes only the production within a country's borders, whereas GNI includes the product produced by enterprises owned by a country's citizens regardless of where they are located. Therefore, if a foreign entity owns productive enterprises in a country, those productions will be included in the GDP but not the GNI of that country. Conversely, production by an enterprise outside the country, but owned by one of its citizens, is part of the country's GNI but not its GDP.
