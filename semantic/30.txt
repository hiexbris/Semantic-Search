Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon that occurs when massive foreground objects bend and warp the fabric of space itself, causing distant light to be magnified and distorted as it passes through. This effect can create multiple images or arcs of a single source. The concept of gravitational lensing allows astronomers to learn more about the amount of mass and dark matter present in foreground objects.

Strong lensing occurs when the lens is very massive, causing light to take different paths to the observer, resulting in multiple images of the source. An example of a double image was found in 1979, of a quasar. The number of lenses discovered has been used to estimate the volume of space back to the sources. In some special cases, the alignment of the source and lens will create an "Einstein ring."

Weak lensing occurs when the gravitational effects of massive objects cause a slight distortion in the light from distant galaxies. This can be used to study the properties of large-scale structure in the universe. In weak lensing, the alignment of the source and lens is usually random, making it more difficult to detect than strong lensing.

Gravitational microlensing occurs when a small massive object passes in front of a much more distant one, bending the light from the background object. This can be used to study the distribution of mass within galaxies and the properties of compact objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars.
