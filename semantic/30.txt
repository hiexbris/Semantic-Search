Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive celestial body such as a galaxy cluster causes sufficient curvature of spacetime for light to be visibly bent, acting like a lens. This is due to Einstein's general theory of relativity, which states that massive objects cause spacetime to curve, and gravity is simply the curvature of spacetime. Therefore, three things are required: an observer, a massive celestial body causing the curvature of spacetime, and light from a more distant source passing near this massive body.
