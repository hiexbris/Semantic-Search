Vaccines trigger immunity by introducing an antigen into the body that imitates an infection and primes the immune system to respond. This causes B-cells and T-cells to get to work, producing antibodies and recognizing and killing cells infected with a virus or other foreign cells. The immune response may cause mild symptoms for a day or two such as fever, chills, or feeling tired. This is because the body is acting as if it's fighting a mild form of the germ, not because it's infected.
