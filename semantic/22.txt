1. A mRNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses a copy of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response. The vaccine delivers molecules of antigen-encoding mRNA into cells, which use the designed mRNA as a blueprint to build foreign protein that would normally be produced by a pathogen or by cancer cells.
2. Vaccines work by teaching the body's immune system how to recognize and fight off specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, without causing the actual illness.
3. The mRNA in a vaccine is taken up by cells and translated into the antigen protein, which then triggers an immune response. This leads to the production of antibodies that can protect against future infections with the same pathogen.
4. Vaccines are essential for preventing the spread of infectious diseases and reducing their impact on public health. They have been instrumental in controlling and eradicating many diseases, such as smallpox and polio.
5. Some people may have an adverse reaction to vaccines due to allergies or other medical conditions. However, these reactions are rare and can usually be managed with appropriate care.
6. The body's immune system is made up of cells and proteins that work together to fight off infections and diseases. Antibodies are a key part of the immune response, acting as soldiers that recognize and attack specific pathogens.
7. Vaccines may require more than one dose to achieve optimal protection, depending on whether the antigen is alive or not. Live-attenuated vaccines can provide enduring protection with only two doses, while non-live vaccines typically require at least three doses.
8. The mRNA in a vaccine does not affect the body's genomic DNA and does not cause any genetic changes.
9. Intramuscular injection is the most common method for delivering coronavirus vaccines, but intranasal vaccines are also being studied to target mucosal immunity in the nasal mucosa.
10. An optimal adjuvant stimulates innate immunity without inducing systemic inflammation that could cause severe side effects. For mRNA vaccines, the mRNA can serve as both immunogen (encoding the viral protein) and adjuvant, owing to intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of RNA.
