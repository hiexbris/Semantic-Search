The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of its atoms to decay. This period is constant and independent of conditions or initial amount. After one half-life, approximately half of the sample remains. The concept is based on probability: after one half-life, on average, exactly half of the atoms will have decayed. Half-lives can be used in studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206. In cases where only one radioactive atom exists, the half-life is defined in terms of probability: "Half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay on average."
