- The most common symptom of dengue is fever with any of the following: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, rash, and mild bleeding (such as bruising or nosebleeds).
   - Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has gone away and include warning signs such as persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, abdominal pain or tenderness, facial swelling, blood in vomit or stool, and signs of shock.
   - Most cases of dengue fever can be treated at home with pain medicine like acetaminophen (paracetamol). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding.
   - Severe dengue cases may require hospitalization for fluid replacement, symptom management, and close monitoring.
   - The only way to avoid contracting dengue virus is to prevent mosquito bites using insect repellent and wear protective clothing, as well as avoiding endemic areas if possible.
