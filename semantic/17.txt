1. Climate change threatens the glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalayan mountain ranges, particularly the ice fields of K2 and Mount Everest.

2. If CO2 emissions are not reduced rapidly, two-thirds of these giant ice fields could disappear this century. Even with a 1.5C temperature rise limit, at least one third will still be lost.

3. The glaciers are a vital water source for approximately 250 million people across eight countries.

4. Rising temperatures and increased air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (one of the world's most polluted regions) accelerate the melting and exacerbate the situation by depositing black carbon and dust on the ice.

5. If global temperatures rise by 2 degrees C, half the glaciers will be gone by 2100. Even with limiting warming to 1.5C by the end of the century, 36% of the glaciers will have disappeared.

6. The impacts on people in the region (one of the world's most fragile and hazard-prone mountain regions) could range from worsened air pollution to an increase in extreme weather events, with changes in pre-monsoon river flows having the most significant impact on urban water systems, food production, and energy.

7. The area covers 3,500km across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan, affecting the ten most important river systems worldwide, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong, and Irrawaddy, which supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air, and incomes.
