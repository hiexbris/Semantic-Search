1. The title of the article is "Melting Glaciers Threaten to Redraw Asia's Map".
2. The text discusses the potential impacts of melting glaciers on water resources and hazards in the Himalayas.
3. The melting glaciers could significantly affect the availability of water resources for millions of people, exacerbating water stress.
4. Changes in the availability of water resources could play an increasing role in political tensions.
5. The scientists are particularly concerned about reductions in pre-monsoon river flows and changes in the monsoon.
6. The glaciers feed ten of the world's most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong, and Irrawaddy.
7. The impact will not just be felt by those living in the mountains, but also by the 1.65 billion people living downstream.
8. The text mentions that the melting of glaciers could accelerate thanks to warming and increased air pollution from a growing population.
9. The air pollutants come from the Indo-Gangetic Plain, one of the world's most polluted regions.
10. The dirty air makes the glacier situation worse by depositing black carbon and dust on the ice, hastening the thaw.
