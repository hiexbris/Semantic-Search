The stages of cell mitosis are not explicitly described in the provided text. However, the text does mention that in animals and plants, a process called meiosis occurs, which is responsible for creating gametes (sex cells) with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This is followed by fertilization or fusion of gametes, resulting in a diploid zygote or new organism with a unique genetic makeup. While not directly stated, this process can be inferred to involve stages similar to prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase that are characteristic of the mitotic cell cycle.
