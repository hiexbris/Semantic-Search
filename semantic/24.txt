Desalination plants work by converting saline water (usually sea water) into fresh water through either distillation or reverse osmosis processes. The two most common methods are multi-stage flash distillation and reverse osmosis, which account for a large majority of the world's desalination capacity. Solar distillation is another method that mimics the natural water cycle, heating seawater to cause evaporation and then condensing the vapor into fresh water. The byproduct of these processes is brine, which contains the salt and minerals removed from the water. Desalination is important for supplying fresh water in regions with scarce freshwater resources but can be energy-intensive and costly.
