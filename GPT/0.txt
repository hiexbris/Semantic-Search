GPT-4o ("o" for omni) is OpenAIâ€™s flagship multimodal model released in May 2024. It represents a significant advancement over GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo, offering improvements in performance, speed, and usability across text, image, audio, and video inputs.

Key Features:
Multimodal Capabilities

Inputs: Accepts text, images, and audio (including real-time speech).

Outputs: Generates text, images, audio, and expressive voice responses.

Enables natural, real-time conversation with voice and vision combined.

Faster & Cheaper

GPT-4o is faster and 50% cheaper than GPT-4-turbo in the OpenAI API.

Optimized for latency-sensitive use cases like real-time agents and chat.

Improved Reasoning & Coding

Performs on par or better than GPT-4-turbo on complex reasoning, coding tasks, and math benchmarks.

Supports 128k context window.

Real-Time Voice Assistant

The new voice mode enables real-time conversation with emotional tone, interruptions, and expressive feedback.

Built-in emotion recognition and reactive responses.

Unified Model Architecture

Unlike earlier models that stitched together multiple subsystems (e.g. Whisper + GPT + TTS), GPT-4o is trained end-to-end across modalities.

This leads to more fluid and natural human-computer interaction.
